Hey

This is really cool. I am glad that someone smarter than me is working on this. I've long been interested in Guile2.2 and beyond, and Lua support is one of those things that I think could skyrocket Guile to an even broader audience, AND this even makes the Lua language a better language, something else I've long since complained about.

Lua is like halfway there to a perfect language, but it's like they slapped some metatables on it and called it a day. Glad people still care about it.
