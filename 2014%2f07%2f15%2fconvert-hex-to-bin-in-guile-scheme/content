<p>Unfortunatly, Guile doesn't provide a method to convert hex to bin (When I'm writing, the current version is 2.0.11).
People have to write their own one.</p>
<p>But fortunatly, writing code in Scheme is kind of enjoy. Every time I've done my program in Scheme, a new idea will strike my head to refactor it.
Then you can't stop to continue to program.</p>
<p>Well, sometimes, we just want a quick way to do our job. But in Scheme, you may become a lib/framework writer unexpectedly. Maybe it's the
worst point of Scheme. And one may enjoy wasting such time...hey I'm sorry Boss...</p>

<p>Here's my version, you may take it for free, or donate some fixes/suggestions/comments. ;-)</p>
<pre class="sh_guile">
(use-modules (rnrs)) ; we need bytevectors in rnrs module

(define (%numstr->bin str final base)
  (define len (string-length str))
  (let lp((i 0) (ret '()))
    (cond
     ((= i len) (final (reverse! ret)))
     (else (lp (+ i 2) (cons (string->number (substring str i (+ i 2)) base) ret))))))

(define (hex->bin str)
  (%numstr->bin str u8-list->bytevector 16))

(define (hex->list str)
  (%numstr->bin str identity 16))

(define (hex->ascii str)
  (%numstr->bin str (lambda (x) (utf8->string (u8-list->bytevector x))) 16))
</pre>

<p>In the beginning, I just need <font color='blue'>hex->bin</font>, but finally, I wrote a high order function for a tiny hex lib.</p>
