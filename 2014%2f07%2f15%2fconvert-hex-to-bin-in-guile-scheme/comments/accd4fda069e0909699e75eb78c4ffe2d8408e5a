<span id='atname'>@Raymond</span> Your suggestions are two:

1) get rid of the `final' argument of %numstr->bin.
(%numstr->bin str final base) isn't any shorter or faster than (final (%numstr->bin str base)); in the latter case it's easier to understand what's happening and there aren't as many positional parameters to remember.

@Raymond Yes, you're right. I agree a callback in final position could be optimized out and put it outside.

2) rename %numstr->bin to %numstr->u8-list.
If you eliminate the `final' parameter as suggested, then %numstr->bin always returns the same type, and you can use a more descriptive name.

@Raymond Yes, it's a related optimize. ;-)
