<p>In spite of a Scheme implementation, Guile is also an extension language platform.
This means you can write new language on it, which could be totally different from Scheme.
Say, PHP/Lua/Ecmascript...and all these front-end will take advantage of the compiling optimization
machenism of Guile.</p>
<p>This article introduced a simple way to define a very simple programing language in 50 lines, in Guile.</p>

<h4>Some concepts</h4>
<p>It's better to clarify something before we start. When I'm talking <font color='red'>'create a language'</font>, I mean designing
the grammar of the language in certain form, usually, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">BNF</a>.
And when I say <font color='red'>'implement a language'</font>, it means writing lexer/parser, then transfer the source code to 
an immediate form, like AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) or other IL(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_language">Intermediate Language</a>) for some optimizations. Finally we may have two choices:</p>
